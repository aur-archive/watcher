# About Watcher

Watcher is a daemon that watches specified files/folders for changes and
fires commands in response to those changes. It is similar to
[incron](http://incron.aiken.cz), however, configuration uses a simpler
to read ini file instead of a plain text file. Unlike incron it can also
recursively monitor directories.

It's written in Python, making it easier to hack.

## Requirements

You need Python 2.7 and the [pyinotify](http://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify)
library.


## Configuration

See the provided `watcher.ini` file for an example job configuration. The
config file should reside in `/etc/conf.d/watcher.ini` or `~/.watcher.ini`.


## Starting the Daemon

Start the daemon with:

    systemctl start watcher.service

Stop it with:

    systemctl stop watcher.service
